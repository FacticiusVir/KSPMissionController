    name = Minmus I
    description = We always see that little thing in our sky, but actually we have no clue what it is. Some think it is a huge marshmallow, some think it is just toothpaste. We need to know those kind of things if we want to explore space! Build a rocket that is able to crash on Minmus. Yes, crash. We can determine the density of Minmus once you crash there and this should settle the discussion.
